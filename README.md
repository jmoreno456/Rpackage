# Rpackage
This R package is called Machine Easier, the purpose is to make the process of predictive modeling easier. There are many libraries to include and sometimes there are too many, 
along with many different function calls that could become too tedious. 
This package is intended to make that easier and less tedious
while this package is still in the early stages
you will notice that included some R scripts including the datatsets iris and mtcars built into R
these examples show the vision i have for this package
