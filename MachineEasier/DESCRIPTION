Description: This package simplifies the process of data cleaning, model building, training, and evaluation for predictive machine learning tasks in R. It provides a streamlined interface for common tasks like data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization, enabling users to perform these tasks with minimal code. By integrating popular R packages like `tidymodels`, `caret`, and `parsnip`, it reduces the complexity and number of function calls required to perform predictive modeling, making machine learning more accessible and easier to use.
